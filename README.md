## What the Extension Does

After installation one will find a button panel within the web UI which looks like the next one.

## Points of Criticism AUTOMATIC1111

<p align="justify">AUTOMATIC1111 uses Gradio to programme the web interface. The Gradio version used is extremely buggy and outdated. Currently my local installed version is 5.0.1, AUTOMATIC1111 is using version 3.41.2. In forum posts can be read that the outdated Gradio version is given priority over an adaptation or update. This does not really motivates to programme extensions.</p>
